# api_testing_python_and_flask
Contains two code files- one has basic python function for api calling, the other file is in Flask framwork.

This was my first try in something like this.


The python file that is calling the api 'main.py' contains all comments which provide details regarding how to use the particular code.

The second code file contains Flask framwork and also contains code for the same.
I have deployed on the local server as of now, some of my future plans include deploying it elsewhere along with a GUI.
